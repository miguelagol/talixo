## Talixo booking App

While solving the task, I put a lot of attention to make my code readable.
I decided to extract UI components like Button, Input etc. to make them reusable (DRY principle). Given that I didn't manage to implement all the features and validation steps. The interface is not the exact copy of the original App but I tried to make it consistent and add some improvements.

The application implements two steps of the booking process. I also decided to mock API data. If I had more time I would add a lot of improvements and missing features.

Feel free to use below voucher codes while testing :)
